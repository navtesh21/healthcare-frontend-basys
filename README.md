This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/dashboard](http://localhost:3000/dashboard) with your browser to see the result.

You need to start the backend repo also, as it is using port 3001 and forntend is using:http://localhost:3001 as the api endpoint, nothing else is required.
